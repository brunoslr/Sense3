# Sense3
Working with senses

Sense3 is a pseudo endless runner.

The player controls a spaceship and has to avoid any obstacle that s/he sees or gets tactile feedback from. 
In the meantime, the player also has to look for audio cues by just using his/her aural sense, move in direction of the sound and pick it up.

The objective of the game is to pick up different tracks so that the player can build his/her own EDM track on the fly.
